Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    I'd say it is O(n). It is visiting every node only once. 

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    O(n). The size of the queue is scaling with the size of the tree. 

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    O(n**2) due to the nested loops. It to just over 10 seconds to run!

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    O(n). The array of duplicates will increase with the size of the files. 

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    O(n) Linear. Is only looping once and now only takes 1.5 seconds to run on my computer.

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    O(n).
